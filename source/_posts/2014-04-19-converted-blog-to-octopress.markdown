Ok quick update to say that I've finally _switched_ over the blog to [Octopress](http://octopress.org). It's been a long time coming because I've been busy with lots of things, blah, blah, blah.

1. Buying a house.
2. Becoming Fulltime at Microsoft BlackTusk
3. Doing a bunch of travelling.

Why?

One of the _big_ reasons being that I've been somewhat nagged, (although [he'll](http://buffered.io) never admit to it), that I should move to a statically hosted site. All the cool kids are doing it so why not? Well, mainly procratistation and lack significant motivation. Well a reather _large_ motivator came in the form of a site I had to host for a friends wedding.

I discovered the somewhat unglamerous side of things when a site I hosted was hacked and started injecting malware to people. PHP seemed to be a inherently insecure framework; a metaphorical swiss cheese of vulnerabilities that was near impossible to stay on top off. As a adminstrator I could never really sleep well at night knowing that it was essentially a shooting gallery for wanna be hackers (script kiddies). The logs very literally full of SQL injection attempts and another Wordpress/PHP style attacks.

Ungreatful bastard

You know the Best Man was actually going to mention me in his speech, saying he'd lost his "entire computer to a virus". Yeah right Jackass. Although I was never there to hear it, thankfully. We haven't spoken since. So clearly PHP is great way of ridding yourself of terrible friends. Lol.

So this is my attempt something to do something a little different. I'm also going to try and reduce my hostings cost as [Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/) and [VpsLink](http://vpslink.com/) are burning a hole in my pocket. House buying will do that I guess. 

I quite like the markdown syntax. If you've never seen it you should [check it out](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). I kind of wish it has existed years ago when I had to churn out a tone of web pages for university.

I did attempt to convert my old blog over to Octopress, but the caching plugin that I had installed, seemed to make nearly impossible to reach the admin console. Joy. So maybe it's a blessing diguise, I'll start a fresh. Yes I know I can dump it out from the SQL instance, but you know I don't really care.

Anyways, I suppose I'll point [Doomkeeper.com](http://doomkeeper.com/blog) at this site when I'm done here.
