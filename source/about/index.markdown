I'm a thirty something ex-pat, computer programming, British dude, living in beautiful [Vancouver, BC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vancouver,+BC/@49.2569777,-123.123904,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x548673f143a94fb3:0xbb9196ea9b81f38b). I've been since 2007 and have written several of these about pages in that time. So, you'd think I'd better at it that this. :)

I'm currently working for [Microsoft BlackTusk](http://mgsvancouver.com/), which is new Games Company based in the downtown core. We're working on the Gears of War franchise. Can't speak too much about it, but it will kick some serrious ass when it's released.
